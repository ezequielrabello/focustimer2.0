## FocusTimer 2.0

#### A project suggested by RocketSeat!  
<img src="/assets/readmepic.png">


In this project, I created a timer with some functions to help people who want to concentrate 
on their studies! 

It's basically a Timer that allows you to Pause, increase or decrease minutes from the Timer.
Not only that, but you can also set a kind of environment and climate you want to be at, such as rain, nature, close to a fireplace or even in a cafeteria!
